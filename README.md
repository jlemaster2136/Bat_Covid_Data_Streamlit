# Coronavirus ecology explorer

I've created [this](https://coronavirus-bat-ecology.streamlit.app/) simple visualization tool out my curiosity for bat disease ecology. 

You can start by selecting a virus genus (or compare them) and then which factor you would like to measure. Do note that this project is a preliminary, exploratory exercise rather than a rigorous examination of the data. 

The data used is from the 2023 metanalysis by Cohen et al., as cited in the references. Thanks for checking it out!
